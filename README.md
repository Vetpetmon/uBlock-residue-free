# uBlock-residue-free
List files for uBlock Origins that aims to clean up the messy &amp; polluted web

This list protects users from sketchy software, phishing, typosquatting attacks, and more.

### DISCLAIMER
Absolutely do not rely on Chromium-based browsers with any kind of security setup. 
Chromium browsers intentionally break adblockers and other security addons.
Pair this with Mozilla-based web browsers like Firefox and Waterfox for a truly protective setup.

## How to use
Simply import the following url into your filter lists:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vetpetmon/uBlock-residue-free/main/residue-clean-up.txt
```
### Experimental, not recommended
If you do not care for performance, you may use the regex list to block phising sites instead.
It is, in theory, far more secure.
